# Welcome

Welcome to the LorinthsRpgItems Wiki! 

Here is where we attempt to keep documentation updated so you know all the tips in tricks to make your server completely unqiue from anyone elses!

But first of all, what is LorinthsRpgItems?

## LorinthsRpgItems

LorinthsRpgItems is a plugin that creates Rpg/Diablo styled loot that is completely random but at the same time completely configurable.

What can you control?

* What plugins it hooks into (Heroes, LorinthsRpgMobs, MythicMobs, SkillAPI, BattleStats, more by request)
* If you don't use external plugins you can use the **[built-in level system](https://bitbucket.org/lorinthslairdevelopment/lorinthsrpgitems/wiki/Built-In%20Level%20System)**
* Allow players to toggle PvP or not
* Change how effects (block, crit, dodge) sound and look (particles!)
* Control how **[attributes](https://bitbucket.org/lorinthslairdevelopment/lorinthsrpgitems/wiki/Attributes)** and lore is displayed on items
* Control generation of items at a **[Rarity](https://bitbucket.org/lorinthslairdevelopment/lorinthsrpgitems/wiki/Rarity)** based level
* Control generation of items at a **Modification** based level
* Control of combat logic using **Formulas** or complete control with **Javascript**
* **Custom Durability** and durability costs
* Default values per material (WOODEN_SWORD vs IRON_SWORD)
* Custom item/texture support using unbreakable items and unique durability. (Including default values for id:durability combination)
* Randomly Generated names created from Prefix + {Random Name} + Suffix logic
* Multi-language support via completely configurable attribute names, display logic, and display settings
* **[Tag based](https://bitbucket.org/lorinthslairdevelopment/lorinthsrpgitems/wiki/Lore%20Generation%20Tags)** item generation system that allows you to apply generation logic to other plugins that drop configurable items with lore.
