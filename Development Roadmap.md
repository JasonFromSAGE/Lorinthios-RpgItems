# Current Roadmap #

1. unidentified items with rarity, and identify scrolls
2. Socket System
3. Region based overrides (gear names, modifications, exp modifiers, etc)
4. Passive point system - Leveling up will provide passive stat points. Passive Stats = Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, (etc). Investing in each Passive Stat will provide increased passive rpg stats. (e.g. investing in Constitution will give increased Health)
5. Weapon Mastery - Using swords will increase sword skill. Higher sword skill will provide passive bonuses
6. Enhancement Scrolls
7. Ascendency Gear - Gear that levels with you and scales with you
