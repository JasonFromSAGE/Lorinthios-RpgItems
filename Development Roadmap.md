# Current Roadmap #

1. unidentified items with rarity, and identify scrolls
2. Custom Gear Set Bonuses
3. Socket System
4. Consumables (and buff system)
5. Region based overrides (gear names, modifications, exp modifiers, etc)
6. Branch off for specific 1.13 support
7. Passive point system - Leveling up will provide passive stat points. Passive Stats = Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, (etc). Investing in each Passive Stat will provide increased passive rpg stats. (e.g. investing in Constitution will give increased Health)
8. Weapon Mastery - Using swords will increase sword skill. Higher sword skill will provide passive bonuses
9. Enhancement Scrolls
10. Ascendency Gear - Gear that levels with you and scales with you
